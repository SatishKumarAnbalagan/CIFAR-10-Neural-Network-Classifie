# CIFAR-10-Neural-Network-Classifie
Neural Network classifier in Python using the Pytorch framework. The dataset used is CIFAR-10 with common classifiers such as Softmax and SVM. Optimization techniques such as mini-batch, batch normalization, dropout and regularization is used. The model is saved in a folder named “model” after finishing the training process. You may need these packages: pytorch, torchvision, (for the CIFAR-10 dataset), NumPy, and OpenCV (for reading images).

# Train
Train a model with the command “python classify.py train”

# Testing
"python classify.py test xxx.png" to predict the class of an image and display the prediction result
