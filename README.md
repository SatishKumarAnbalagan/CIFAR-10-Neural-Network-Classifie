# CIFAR-10-Neural-Network-Classifie
Neural Network classifier in Python using the Pytorch framework. The dataset used is CIFAR-10 with common classifiers such as Softmax and SVM. Optimization techniques such as mini-batch, batch normalization, dropout and regularization is used. You may need these packages: pytorch, torchvision, (for the CIFAR-10 dataset), NumPy, and OpenCV (for reading images).
